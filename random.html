<!--First, set up a button that when clicked changes an html element // I don't know if this is supposed to go her or on random.js-->

<!--Then set up a separate button that when clicked changes a css property-->

<!--Next set up a text box and third button that provides some kind of feedback to the user when they enter in text and click a submit button.-->

<!--Now use the same randomization logic to do something creative (like add elements to the page, 
    trigger audio/visual feedback, etc) in a way that depends on the random number returned (adding 40 divs with unique 
    and interesting css properties to the page when the user enters a number range between 0 and 100 and the number generator 
    returns 40 for example would satisfy this requirement, but try to be creative here and do something fun like make 40 stars 
    appear or 40 balloons fly up)-->
