/*This is the javascript game file: Now on a new page called game.html, create and link to a javascript file called game.js 
that contains a simple game that uses a similar kind of random number generator but has an interesting core game loop to play 
(for example card games like war and blackjack, dice rolling games, number guessing games, etc. would all satisfy this requirement). */
